          <h2>The Big Apple</h2>
          <p>
            For my third co-op I was apart of the Foundry, Pipeline Builder Core
            team at Palantir, as a Software Engineer Intern. This time I was in
            the big apple (New York City) and had quite the fast paced
            internship. Palantir is a Data Integration company and helps
            enterprises take there huge distributed data across all channels,
            put it into one platform and pretty much do anything they want from
            there with the data. Foundry takes different distributed and
            scattered data sources, integrates them into one platform, allow
            users to connect the data and create real life object
            representations known as ontologies. Pipeline Builder specifically
            allowed users to take their data and form both streaming and batch
            production pipelines in our no code tool. Whether they wanted to
            perform analytics, create ontologies, or simply clean some data, the
            possibilities within builder are endless. My work was spread out
            between our microservices backend and front end repo. I worked by
            myself for my project with consistent check ins with mentor, leads,
            co-workers and overall team.

          <h2>Coop Goals</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Learn Technical Problem Solving and Learn Industry Tools.
            </li>
            <p>
              A lot of my work was done alongside talented engineers, in depth
              code reviews, and technically challenging projects. Because of
              this I would now say I have very high standards when writing and
              reviewing code, making code maintainable, solving problems using
              elegant solutions and most importantly writing code that is easy
              to understand. I also learned a lot about the industry tools and
              practices, such as very in-depth git features for specific actions
              (work trees, cherry picking, etc.), the importance of code
              reviews, and using modern day programming practices including
              features borrowed from other languages (talking about rust here). I also
              learned a lot about the importance of testing, and how to write
              extremely through tests for back end code.
            </p>

            <br />

            <li>
              Learn new backend technologies whether it be databases systems,
              cloud services, internal services/architecture, and more
            </li>
            <p>
              I learned a lot about the internal services and architecture of a
              large scale product such as Foundry. There are a lot more
              challenges and things to consider when dealing with data intensive
              applications, large scale problems, and frequent product update
              releases. With that being said I would say I got a very wide range
              of experience with different technologies, including but not
              limited to: Java backends, Gradle, Postman, JUnit, and tons and
              tons of internal tools/services.

          <h2>Conclusion and Acknowledgements</h2>
          <p>
            My time at Palantir was probably my best yet as I got to enjoy
            everything NYC has to offer, and I have nothing but great things to
            say about my team, mentor, leads, and company. While this was one
            big chapter in my life with tons of growth and new experiences, I am
            always looking forward to the next one and see where my journey
            takes me.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would like to acknowledge my mentor Adam Skrocki, my lead Drew
            Thoennes, product designer Nanwei Cai, and my team members (Richard
            Burdish and Tiffany Wang). This team was always kind, giving great
            feedback throughout my internship, and overall just great people.
            They made my internship the great experience that it was and I cannot
            thank them enough for helping me grow in more ways than just
            technical. Anytime I felt stuck, confused, or needed a hand, always
            had someone to fall back on, while also being encouraged to push
            myself throughout different scenarios. This was an experience I will
            never forget, and I am happy that I got to be on the Pipeline
            Builder team/journey.
