                    <h2>Complete Turn Around</h2>
                    <p>In my second co-op I was apart of team phoenix at ProNavigator, as a Software Engineer Intern. 
                        The entire work term was remote for me from Monday to Friday and lots of ranging responsibilities. 
                        ProNavigator is a Artificial Intelligence company and is responsible for managing, organizing,
                        and providing all sorts of services to insurance companies with tons of documents through their main product: Ask Sage.
                        Their main service was a strong search engine backed with powerful features to make the workflows
                        for these insurances companies much faster and more efficient. A lot of my work ranged based on
                        team tasked and I worked directly with product alongside my new team members. 
                        My work was mostly by myself with multiple team meetings throughout
                        the weekly with the occasional meetings with other teams and even the whole company.

                    <h2>Coop Goals</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Learning AWS, Python, FastAPI, React and Javascript</li>
                        <p>When switching from my last coop to this one, a lot of hurdles came simply by the new tech stack.
                            Working comfortably with technologies and languages I had little to no work experience
                            it became the first hurdle. With that being said one of my goals immediately became to walk out of
                            this coop with enough knowledge where if I wanted to build my own app or contribute to a project
                            using this tech stack I could do so with full confidence. My plan to overcome this was a 2 step
                            process involving many aspects of work. Firstly, I wanted to pair program with mentors when I got to chance
                            to try and see how seniors in the field manage through different types of problems and what sorts
                            of methodologies they use to solve them. Second was rather intuitive but required pushing boundaries
                            I would try to take tickets ranging in technologies used. For example if my last task was to implement or fix
                            some code on the front end using React I would immediately try to do a backend or infrastructure ticket next
                            if possible to keep myself on my toes and sharp throughout the term. Reflecting back both of these strategies
                            worked out for me and I do feel confident in my skills and I came out learning all sorts of structural practices,
                            navigating and debugging techniques, development tips and many other things which made me a strong web developer.
                        </p>

                        <br>

                        <li>Technical Knowledge about Web Development Concepts</li>
                        <p>While knowledge around the languages I worked with themselves proved very valuable,
                            at the end of the day if you aren't a good software engineer a lot of the code you write
                            for lack of better words is just spaghetti. With that being said both React and FastAPI (API design in general)
                            have a lot of structure, best practices, and other decisions that need to be made to make them
                            as modular and extensible as possible. To overcome this my original plan was to pair program, however
                            my plan quickly changed as throughout the term I found other means to have criticism and insight from senior developers.
                            This included pull request reviews from as many people as possible, engaging in conversation and asking design questions
                            when working on tickets, and of course also through pair programming to break down a problem with another developer.
                            With that being said I really do believe I accomplished this very well to my surprise, I was able to not only
                            learn foreign languages and frameworks, but also the fundamentals of web development, 
                            how to design React (dependencies, state management and responsibilities) components
                            and how to break down a singular endpoint into a set of different reusable services and responsibilities. 
                            Overall my learning on this goal was a huge success and I feel comfortable, managing, navigating, implementing
                            and designing web components from frontend, backend, infra, and cloud.

                    <h2>Conclusion and Acknowledgements</h2>
                    <p>Overall my time at ProNavigator was simply the best and
                        I have nothing but great things to say about my team, mentors, company and the work I had.
                        I cannot wait to take my set of knowledge with experience and apply it to all future endeavors. 
                        While I am super excited for what the future may hold, ProNavigator will always be an important
                        experience that shaped me into the developer I am today.
                    </p>
                    <p>I would like to acknowledge my mentor Leah who was always the most supportive person
                        throughout my term. Anytime I felt stuck, confused, or needed a hand, she would always
                        be there for the support. Alongside this gave lots of amazing feedback and pushed me 
                        to always go above and beyond in many aspects of my work. Overall she helped refine my skills
                        and improve my weak points.
