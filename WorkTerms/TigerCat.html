                    <h2>The First One</h2>
                    <p>For my first co-op I worked at TigerCat Industries, as a Software Developer
                        on the Desktop Applications and Backend Services Team. I worked in the office
                        at the Paris location from Monday to Friday from 8 am to 4:30 pm est. 
                        TigerCat is a machinery company and is responsible for designing, manufacturing,
                        programming and shipping out their machinery to clients. A lot of my work was creating
                        new services and applications to allow engineers to make the production
                        of new machinery, a faster process for themselves and the manufacturers.
                        My work was completely autonomous with two weekly team meetings with the team lead
                        and product manager to discuss the current state of the services/application and the next steps.

                    <h2>Coop Goals</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Learn C#/.NET</li>
                        <p>One of the main languages used for creating modern Windows Desktop Applications,
                            is C# with .NET Framework. Despite this I came into work with only experience
                            in basic Java and absolutely 0 experience with the .NET platform or C#. At the
                            start I was pretty much spending the majority of my time creating the foundation
                            of the application, pair programming with my Team Lead and asking a lot of 
                            questions. After picking up on the basics of the language I was let go of and
                            began developing completely on my own, which was quite difficult at first. 
                            However towards the end of my work term I was applying many different patterns
                            and technologies. This included things like Parallel Threading, Asynchronous 
                            Programming, Design Patterns, SOLID, and Dependency Injection, just to list a few.
                        </p>

                        <br>

                        <li>Applying Testing and Best Practices</li>
                        <p>This may come as a surprise for more young developers like myself,
                            but testing and organization matter. At the start of my coop I went
                            straight into developing my application with all the features and 
                            trying to get it to work as fast as possible. However as I came to learn, 
                            when developing software which is going to be refactored a lot with ever 
                            changing features you have to make sure you have a set plan with routines. 
                            Towards the end of my coop after I had finished my projects I found myself 
                            writing more tests, fixing bugs and refactoring code so that new functionality 
                            can be easily implemented. Had I taken the time to think of my system design 
                            before going and implementing it, I would have saved a lot of that unnecessary 
                            code refactoring later on. It was to the point where mid way I had to 
                            completely redo an entire feature from scratch simply because adding functionality 
                            to it was becoming too difficult. By the end I became a much stronger developer 
                            in both design intuition and also simply taking time to make sure the base 
                            components are tested and working as needed.
                        </p>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>After a completely hectic and fast four months
                        I was at the end of my first coop. It was an amazing experience and
                        I was able to learn a lot, both from a technical and non technical aspect.
                        Going forward the lessons I learned will be invaluable and I recommend
                        that all early developers make sure to not get too intimidated when starting their
                        first internship, it will only get better.
